# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Assignment
This Java program is designed to implement various graph algorithms, including Dijkstra’s
shortest path tree (SPT) algorithm. Graph algorithms are fundamental in computer science and
find extensive applications in various domains, including network routing, social network
analysis, and optimization problems.

Graphs are mathematical structures composed of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting these
nodes. They are used to model relationships between entities in a wide range of scenarios. This
program focuses on weighted, connected graphs, where each edge has a numerical weight
representing the cost or distance between nodes.

Dijkstra’s algorithm is a well-known graph algorithm used to find the shortest paths from a
source node to all other nodes in a graph. It operates efficiently on graphs with non-negative
edge weights and produces a shortest path tree (SPT) rooted at the source node.

The objective of this program is to implement Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the shortest
path tree (SPT) for a given graph. Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting graph data and
selecting the source node. Display the resulting shortest path tree (SPT) to the console, along
with any intermediate steps or workings for clarity and understanding.

This program will be structured to allow for easy extension to other graph algorithms, such as
Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees (MST) and various graph traversal techniques
like depth-first traversal (DFS) and breadth-first traversal (BFS).
The program will adhere to best practices in Java programming, including proper code
organization, modular design, and extensive commenting for clarity and maintainability.
Additionally, it will incorporate user input validation and error handling to ensure robustness
and reliability.

Overall, this Java program aims to provide a comprehensive implementation of Dijkstra’s
algorithm for finding shortest paths in weighted graphs, along with supporting functionalities
to facilitate experimentation and understanding of graph algorithms.

The assignment involves implementing and analysing various graph traversal algorithms like
DFS, BFS, Prim's algorithm for MST, and Dijkstra's algorithm for SPT. It also requires
representing the graph using an adjacency list and understanding the steps involved in
constructing MST and SPT using Prim's and Dijkstra's algorithms respectively.
